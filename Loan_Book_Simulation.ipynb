    "# Simulate loan book\n",
    "Douglas McLean, 28/6/2023\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Ask\n",
    "Simulate the loan book composition over time between five domiciled retail banks. The banks all start with zero loans written. They fund their loans with cash from their current accounts, savings book and by borrowing from each other and their central bank. Their savings accounts have different initial amounts but are drawn from a normal distribution of mean £1 billion and standard deviation £5 million (there is some £870bn in U.K. savings accounts spread amongst some 73 retail banks operating in the U.K.). Market interest rates fluctuate and are risky. The banks charge interest on their loans. They offer loans between £1000 and £25000. The banks change their interest rates competitively to maximise their returns. The  components needed to write a simulation model in Python over time are as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Modelling Points\n",
    "1. Banks: Create a class to represent each bank, including attributes such as current account balance, savings account balance, loan book composition, interest rates, and methods to update these attributes based on simulation rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Loans: Generate loans with random amounts between £1000 and £25000. Assign these loans to the banks based on their funding sources and update the loan book composition of each bank accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Funding: Define the rules for banks to fund their loans. This can include using cash from their current accounts, savings accounts, borrowing from each other, and borrowing from the central bank. Implement methods to update the funding sources and loan book composition based on these rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Interest Rates: Define a model to simulate fluctuating and risky market interest rates. This can be based on historical data or a stochastic process. Update the interest rates of each bank competitively to maximize their returns. Consider the impact of interest rate changes on the loan book composition and profitability of each bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Simulation Loop: Write a loop to simulate the system over time. In each iteration, update the funding, interest rates, loan book composition, and profitability of each bank. Monitor and record the changes in the loan book composition and other relevant metrics at each time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Analysis and Visualization: After running the simulation, analyze and visualize the results to understand the dynamics of the loan book composition over time. This can involve plotting the loan book composition, profitability, and other key metrics for each bank.\n",
